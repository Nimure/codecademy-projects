#4. Average
#Letâ€™s create a function which takes the average of two numbers. These two numbers will be the input of the function and the output will be the average of the two.

# Write your average function here:
def average(num1, num2):
  average = ((num1 + num2) * 0.5)
  return average
# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:

#print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
#print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0
