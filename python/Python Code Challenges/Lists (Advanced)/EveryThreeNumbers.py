#1. Every Three Numbers
#Letâ€™s start our challenging problems with a function that creates a list of numbers up to 100 in increments of 3 starting from a number that is passed to the function as an input parameter.

#Write your function here
def every_three_nums(start):
  return list(range(start, 101, 3))


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(every_three_nums(91))
