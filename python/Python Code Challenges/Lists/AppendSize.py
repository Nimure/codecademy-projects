#1. Append Size
#For the first code challenge, we are going to calculate the length of a list and then append the value to the end of the list.

#Write your function here
def append_size (lst):
  lst.append(len(lst))
  return lst


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(append_size([23, 42, 108]))
