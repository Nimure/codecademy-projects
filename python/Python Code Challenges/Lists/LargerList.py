#3. Larger List
#Letâ€™s say we are working with two conveyor belts that contain items represented by a numerical ID. If one conveyor belt contains more items than the other, then we need to return the ID of the last item on that belt. In the case where they have the same number of items, return the last item from the first conveyor belt. In our code, we can represent the belts using lists. 

#Write your function here
def larger_list(lst1, lst2):
  if len(lst1) >= len(lst2):
    return lst1[-1]
  else:
    return lst2[-1]


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(larger_list([4, 10, 2, 5], [-10, 2, 5, 10]))
#print(larger_list([4, 10, 2, 5, 6], [-10, 2, 5, 10]))
#print(larger_list([4, 10, 2, 5], [-10, 2, 5, 10, 7]))
