#3. Delete Starting Even Numbers
#Letâ€™s try a tricky challenge involving removing elements from a list. This function will repeatedly remove the first element of a list until it finds an odd number or runs out of elements. It will accept a list of numbers as an input parameter and return the modified list where any even numbers at the beginning of the list are removed. 

#Write your function here
def delete_starting_evens(lst):
  while (len(lst) > 0 and lst[0] % 2 == 0):
    lst = lst[1:]
  return lst

#Uncomment the lines below when your function is done
#print(delete_starting_evens([4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15]))
#print(delete_starting_evens([4, 8, 10]))
