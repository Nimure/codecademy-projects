#1. Divisible By Ten
#Letâ€™s start our code challenges with a function that counts how many numbers are divisible by ten from a list of numbers. This function will accept a list of numbers as an input parameter and use a loop to check each of the numbers in the list. Every time a number is divisible by 10, a counter will be incremented and the final count will be returned.

#Write your function here
def divisible_by_ten(nums):
  count = 0
  for number in nums:
    if (number % 10 == 0):
      count += 1
  return count

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(divisible_by_ten([20, 25, 30, 35, 40]))
